As of **2023.01.22**, I have decided that I will no longer continue translation of BTD5E, and probably the rest of bloons genre. This is because BTD5 is slowly gonna die out, while btd6 has official NK translation.
With this, I want to state, that you can continue my work for version 12 and, if it comes out, for version 13 of Expansion.

If you have any questions, you can DM me on Discord (I will probably stick around on **[5h3i1ah's BTD5 Modding Server](https://discord.gg/WSFfYCY6zQ)**) and my username is GerbilPL (wow Sherlock).

**Feel free to distribute localization files or whatever you want to do with them, although I'd prefer if you left my signature at end of the file.**
**For font assets, ask Sheilah.**

Thanks for reading - GerbilPL
